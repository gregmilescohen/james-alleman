<p>
<b>Access Charge:</b> That portion of the monthly bill for exchange
service which is independent of usage. This component reflects
the rate to access the network and receive calls.
</p><p>
<b>Allowance, Usage:</b> The "free" usage granted to
a customer before charging for the usage. This may be integrated
with the access charge or separately stated.
</p><p>
<b>B1 rates:</b> One party exchange service (see below) for business
customers.
</p><p>
<b>Basic Calling Area: </b>The area in which telephone usage is
provided without a distance charge.
</p><p>
<b>Basic Service: </b>See Exchange Service
</p><p>
<b>Bypass: </b>When a (potential) customer uses alternative means
of connection to the network rather than use the traditional carrier
as its provider.
</p><p>
<b>Call:</b> (For billing purposes) a successful, completed connection
by a customer. (This is not the standard telephony definition
of the term "call".)
</p><p>
<b>Call Classification:</b> The systematic arrangement of calls
into distinct groups based on identifiably unique demand and/or
cost characteristics (e.g., credit card calls, directory assistance
calls, calls employing Custom Calling Features).
</p><p>
<b>Call Duration:</b> The time interval between the off-hook condition
of the called number and the subsequent disconnection by either
the calling or called number.
</p><p>
<b>Call Set-Up: </b>The process of successfully establishing the
communicating path between the calling and called party.
</p><p>
<b>Central Office (CO):</b> A communication switching center which
employs one or more NXX codes for the switching of local traffic.
Allows connections to other subscribers, tandem offices, the inter-exchange
carriers (IXCs), cellular networks, etc.
</p><p>
<b>Circuit: </b>(Twisted pair) to Central Office: Fixed and invariant
with usage. This relationship is changing with distributed process
networks.
</p><p>
<b>Customer Provided Equipment (CPE):</b> Telecommunications equipment
at the customer's premises, which is competitively provided by
any firm which meets the Federal Communications Commission certification
requirements.
</p><p>
<b>Consumer Surplus:</b> The benefit derived by a consumer from
the consumption of a good or service beyond what the customer
paid for it.
</p><p>
<b>Cost-based Pricing:</b> Prices that are specifically related
to cost associated with the production of a good or service.
</p><p>
<b>Derived Demand </b>describes business demand for productive
inputs i.e., firms do not demand a good or service for its own
sake, but for what it can contribute to producing a given output
at least cost.
</p><p>
<b>Distance: </b>The airline mileage between the originating location
of a call and the terminating location of that call. (Location,
as used above, is envisioned to be the wire center's V and H coordinates.)
</p><p>
<b>Economic Profit</b> : Profit over and above a normal return
on investment. Accounting profit is greater than economic profit.
Accounting costs would, generally, be below the economic costs.
</p><p>
<b>Economies of Scale:</b> Exists if proportional increases in
inputs more than proportionally increase output. Mathematically,
if and only if
</p><p>
</p><center>f(ax1,ax2, .. axn) &gt; aQ, for a &gt; 1</center>
<p>
where xi 's are inputs and Q is the output.
</p><p>
Economies of scale can arise from a number of sources. Larger
capital items (e.g. machines) may be able to produce several units
at a lower unit cost than the machine that would be required for
low levels of production. A simple if perhaps obvious example
would be the production of a single automobile versus the production
of hundreds of thousands. In the latter case, it would pay to
develop dyes, presses, etc. to fabricate parts, but for one or
two cars per year this would not even be considered.
</p><p>
<b>Economies of Scope: </b>When a firm is able to produce two
or more different products jointly at a lower unit cost than producing
each separately.
</p><p>
<b>Efficiency: </b>The least-cost combination of inputs required
to produce a given level of output or, alternatively, for a given
combination of inputs, the combination of outputs which yields
the maximum economic value from society's point of view.
</p><p>
<b>Elastic Demand:</b> Whether derived or consumer demand, is
demand that is responsive to price changes. Specifically a given
percentage increase or decrease in price is accompanied by a larger
percentage decrease or increase, respectively, in quantity demanded.
Its absolute value is greater than one. (See Elasticity, below)
</p><p>
<b>Elasticity:</b> The sensitivity of quantity demanded to a change
in the variable of interest. Thus price elasticity of demand is:
</p><p>
</p><center>= (Qi/Qi)/( Pi/Pi) or </center>
<p>
</p><center>= (dQi/dPi)/(Pi/Qi)</center>
<p>
where Pi is the price of the. good or service and Qi is the quantity.
</p><p>
<b>Income elasticity</b>, more precisely, the income elasticity
of demand, is the responsiveness of demand to changes in income,
that is, purchasing power.
</p><p>
All other elasticities are similarly defined.
</p><p>
<b>Equal access</b> allows all carriers the ability to offer +
1 dialing. Dialing 10xxx allows individuals to reach any IXC.
</p><p>
<b>Exchange: </b>A geographical area within which there is a single
uniform set of charges for telephone service. The exchange presently
serves as the basis of calibrating the distance factor in the
toll tariffs.
</p><p>
<b>Exchange Service:</b> can be divided into two major services:
</p><p>
<b>Subscriber Access:</b> The connection to the network
</p><p>
Local or Exchange Usage
</p><p>
(Note, Local Exchange Service is redundant)
</p><p>
<b>Externalities</b> : There are two externalities associated
with telephone service: <b>call</b> and <b>access</b>. The call
externality arises from the impact, positive or negative, upon
the called party, which is in addition to the benefit received
by the caller, who, by definition, must regard the benefit to
be at least as great as the cost. Obviously, not all calls received
are regarded as beneficial by those called, and one manifestation
of this is unlisted numbers. But, on balance, the call externality
is very likely positive.
</p><p>
The access externality arises each time an additional subscriber
joins the network because there is now one more party that the
previously existing community can reach. This is thought to be
a benefit that continues to accrue as the network increases without
limit, and it is the rationale for charging subscribers to larger
exchanges more for access than subscribers to smaller exchanges.
This externality is more critical in developing countries where
the systems have very low penetration. There are large numbers
of subscribers whose access, insofar as it enables one to reach,
and be reached by them, is irrelevant, except to the extent that
the costs to all are reduced due to economies of scale.
</p><p>
<b>Flat-rate Pricing: </b>Pricing a service at a uniform price
irrespective of the volume consumed. This is a common pricing
practice for exchange service in the United States.
</p><p>
<b>Incentive Regulation:</b> As opposed to Rate of Return Regulation,
and is usually in the form of price caps, see below.
</p><p>
<b>Inefficient Entry:</b> The establishment of a firm(s) whose
cost function lies everywhere above that of already existing firms
in an industry.
</p><p>
<b>Inelastic Demand:</b> Whether derived or consumer demand, is
demand that is not very responsive to price changes. Specifically
a given percentage increase or decrease in price is accompanied
by a smaller percentage decrease or increase, respectively, in
quantity demanded. Its absolute value is less than one. (See Elasticity,
above)
</p><p>
<b>International Settlements: </b>The payment from one country's
telecommunications entity to another for the carriage of its traffic
to the terminating point in the recipient's country. Settlement
rates have not been based on the costs of the transmission.
</p><p>
<b>LEC:</b> Local Exchange Carrier (see note above). Include the
RBOCs, GTE, Sprint (United) and some 1,300 exchange carriers.
</p><p>
<b>LATA: </b>Local Access Transport Area, geographical areas defined
by the Modified Final Judgment (MFJ) when the divestiture of the
Bell System was implemented in 1984.
</p><p>
<b>Local Calling Area:</b> The geographical area wherein calls
are charged according to local exchange tariffs (presently, the
majority of local exchange tariffs utilize a flat rate price structure).
</p><p>
<b>Local Loop:</b> A circuit connecting a customer premise to
a central office.
</p><p>
<b>Local Measured Service:</b> The provision of local (non-toll)
telephone service in which charges are made for local usage in
addition to a monthly access charge.
</p><p>
<b>Long Run:</b> That period of time in which all factors of production
are variable and optimum changes can be effected.
</p><p>
<b>Margin (or Incremental) Cost:</b> The cost associated with
the additional (incremental) cost of providing an additional unit
of output. The change in total cost associated with an additional
unit of output.
</p><p>
<b>Modified Final Judgment (MFJ):</b> The agreement between AT&amp;T
and the Justice Department which settled the AT&amp;T anti-trust
case and resulted in the divestiture of AT&amp;T (the Bell System)
from its exchange carriers. The MFJ also included rules and regulations
for the newly created Regional Bell Operating Companies. In particular,
it had several line-of business restrictions with which they had
to comply. The MFJ was administered by Judge Harold Greene.
</p><p>
<b>Monopoly:</b> A single supplier of a good or service. A "natural"
monopoly exhibits economies of scale and scope which, if its prices
are based on costs, will generally prevent entry of competition.
</p><p>
<b>Natural Monopoly</b> : The concept of natural monopoly is that
of an industry in which there is room for only one supplier, due
to some aspect of the production process or the market. Traditionally,
a declining long run marginal cost curve, i.e., economies of scale,
was considered the defining characteristic of a natural monopoly.
More recent research indicates that what is known as strict cost
sub-additivity is the appropriate cost test. Strict cost sub-additivity
means one firm can produce more cheaply than two or more firms.
Necessary and/or sufficient conditions exist on the cost function
for it to be sub-additive. See Economies of Scale and Scope.
</p><p>
<b>Opportunity Cost</b> : The cost associated with the next best
alternative use of an input.
</p><p>
<b>Pareto Improvement: </b>A move toward Pareto Optimality. An
improvement in the benefits for some without the loss of benefits
by others.
</p><p>
<b>Pareto Optimality</b> : Even if the price is set at marginal
cost, this may not be a move toward Pareto optimality, since the
necessary conditions outside the industry have not been met. This
has been termed in the literature the problem of "second
best".
</p><p>
<b>Peak Period:</b> The time interval when a central office switching
system carries the most traffic.
</p><p>
<b>POP: </b>Point of Presence, the interface between the exchange
carrier and IXC.
</p><p>
<b>Predatory Pricing:</b> Pricing below cost with the express
purpose of preventing a potential competitor from entering the
market or driving a competitor out of the market.
</p><p>
<b>Premium Flat Rate Option:</b> A tariff offering designed for
high usage customers in which local usage is billed at a high
fixed monthly price which approximates the total cost.
</p><p>
<b>Price Caps:</b> A means of regulating the prices charged by
carriers which requires that a bundle of service offerings have
a weighted average change no greater than a set percentage over
a given period of time. This percentage is usually based on a
(consumer) price index less an allowance for productivity changes.
It is the method of regulating British Telecom, AT&amp;T and certain
exchange carriers e.g. in California.
</p><p>
<b>Price Elasticity of Demand:</b> The percentage change in quantity
demanded divided by a percentage change in the price of the service.
See Elasticity, above.
</p><p>
<b>Productivity:</b> The creation of economic value. The ratio
of physical output to physical input; often approximated by the
ratio of the value of output to the value of input.
</p><p>
<b>R1 rates:</b> One party exchange service rates (see above)
for residential customers.
</p><p>
<b>Rate Averaging:</b> Setting uniform rates based on an average,
such as uniform rates per kilometer without regard for costs.
</p><p>
<b>Rate Base Regulations:</b> Regulation based on the size of
the (depreciated) capital stock i.e. the amount of investment
in telephone plant and equipment.
</p><p>
<b>Rate Re-balancing: </b>Changing rates toward a cost basis.
The practice usually occurs in response to threats of competition.
</p><p>
<b>Regulation:</b> A method of control of a firm, company or industry
through a series of rules and regulations. Regulations are usually
formulated and implemented by a government or public body.
</p><p>
<b>Resale:</b> The ability of a carrier to purchase circuits or
usage from another carrier and sell them to end users.
</p><p>
<b>Restructuring: </b>Used in reference to the privatization or
structural changes in the operation, ownership and control of
the telephone administration or other government entity. Usually
used in the context of privatization.
</p><p>
<b>Revenue Stability:</b> A relatively low variance in the revenue
flows over time.
</p><p>
<b>Separations: </b>The division of telephone plant accounts and
costs into exchange, inter- and intra-state toll.
</p><p>
<b>Settlements / Division of Revenues: </b>The dividing of the
toll revenues among the exchange carriers via Subscriber Line
Usage charges.
</p><p>
<b>Subscriber Access</b> : The connection by an individual user
to the (switched) central office of the telephone company. It
is, in general, a fixed cost; but in most countries part of the
cost is covered by usage charges.
</p><p>
<b>Subscriber Access Charges:</b> The charges which are imposed
on the business and residential subscribers to cover, partially,
the cost of subscriber access. The charge comes from the Separation
charges assigned to the federal jurisdiction. Currently it is
approximately $ 3.50 per month for residential customers and $7.50
for business subscribers.
</p><p>
Tandem Office: Connect the CO in the same fashion as the subscribers
are consolidated with COs, i.e., it connects COs to one another.
</p><p>
<b>Tariff:</b> The formalization of the prices and other rules
associated with the provision of an utility service offering.
</p><p>
<b>Time-of-Occurrence:</b> The time-of-day or day-of-week at which
a call occurs.
</p><p>
<b>Toll Service:</b> defined as non-exchange service. It can be
sub-divided into:
</p><p>
International calls
</p><p>
Inter-LATA inter-state calls
</p><p>
Inter-LATA intra-state calls
</p><p>
Intra-LATA inter-state calls
</p><p>
Intra-LATA intra-state calls
</p><p>
The Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) could <b>only </b>offer
service in the latter two due to the Modified Final Judgment (MFJ).
If they met certain competitive conditions, they can enter any
of the toll markets since the passage of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996.
</p><p>
Alternative carriers can provide service in the first three markets
and, in some cases, the latter two services.
</p><p>
<b>Traffic Sensitive Costs:</b> The costs associated with the
quantity of utilization of a service. A sub-set of what the economist
refers to as variable costs.
</p><p>
<b>Universal Measured Service:</b> The provision of network telephone
service (including toll) in which charges are made to all customers
for usage in addition to a monthly access charge.
</p><p>
<b>Universal Service:</b> Refers to market penetration of the
telephone service to as many members of the society as possible.
</p><p>
<b>Usage-sensitive Pricing:</b> Pricing of service based on the
volume of service used by the customer, as opposed to flat-rate
pricing (See above).
</p><p>
<b>Wire Center:</b> That central office location which serves
as the focus of local loops for a defined geographical area.
